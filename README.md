# Memory Game Project

This project is part of Udacity's FEND and is based on a classic card game. The game can be found here: https://stepanovamonika.github.io/Frontend-Memory-Game/

## Instructions

There are 16 cards with 8 different images in the game. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. A player selects 2 cards to reveal the image. If the cards match, they will remain open. If the cards do not match, they will turn over and the player can choose different cards. The game ends when all card are matched.

Once the game is over, the player will receive a star rating with the elapsed time and number of moves it took him to finish the game.
